# Secure Shield Pro Update Landing Page

## Overview
This project is a **landing page** for the **Secure Shield Pro** update, which provides users with a critical system update. The page explains the purpose of the update, gives a clear download button, and includes a **disclaimer** about downloading the update from a local server.

The page is designed to be **simple, professional**, and **easy to navigate**. The update can be downloaded automatically by clicking the **Download Update** button, which triggers the download of a local file hosted on the server.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Download Button**: Automatically triggers the download of a ZIP file containing the Secure Shield Pro update.
- **Disclaimer**: Informs users about the **local update** and advises caution before downloading.
- **Clean and Simple UI**: The design is minimal, focusing on user experience and clarity.

## Demo
You can view the live demo of this page hosted on GitHub Pages:

## How It Works
